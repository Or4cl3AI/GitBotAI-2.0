# GitBotAI 2.0 Web App

## Overview

GitBotAI is a versatile and powerful web application designed to streamline developers' workflows on GitHub. With its conversational AI chatbot and seamless integration with the GitHub API, GitBotAI simplifies code generation, repository management, version control, and deployment. The web app consists of both frontend and backend components, ensuring a secure, user-friendly, and efficient experience for developers.

## Frontend Components

### Conversational Interface (IFrame)

The heart of GitBotAI is the conversational AI chatbot, which developers interact with using natural language queries. The conversational interface is embedded within the web app using an iframe element. Developers can access the chatbot by navigating to specific sections of the web app. The iframe, with the source URL `https://ora.ai/embed/2016a484-b6bd-446f-9061-16fc900331b5`, is styled with a fixed height and width (e.g., `height: "600px", width: "400px"`) to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface.

### User Interface (UI)

The frontend includes a user interface that complements the conversational interface, providing additional features and interactions. The UI allows users to trigger specific actions, such as generating code, managing repositories, and controlling versioning, by clicking buttons or submitting forms.

### Styling and CSS

The frontend is styled using CSS or a styling library like Bootstrap to provide an appealing and cohesive visual experience. CSS is used to ensure that the iframe, buttons, and other UI elements are appropriately positioned and responsive.

## Backend Components

### Server

GitBotAI's backend is powered by a server built using a technology like Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or other backend frameworks. The server acts as a bridge between the frontend components and the GitHub API, facilitating secure communication and data exchange.

### GitHub API Integration

The server handles API calls to the GitHub API on behalf of the web app. It communicates with the GitHub API to perform various operations like code generation, repository management, version control, and authentication. User authentication is managed through OAuth or GitHub's native mechanism, allowing GitBotAI to access the required repositories securely.

### Message Passing and API Requests

To enable seamless communication between the frontend and the backend, message passing techniques like postMessage or API requests like fetch or Axios are used. When a user interacts with the conversational interface (IFrame) or triggers an action in the UI, the frontend sends messages or API requests to the backend, which then processes the request and returns relevant data or actions.

## Workflow

### User Installation

Developers can install GitBotAI as a GitHub app on their repositories. During installation, they grant the app the necessary permissions to access their repositories securely.

### Interacting with GitBotAI

Once installed, developers can interact with GitBotAI through GitHub's web interface or directly within their repository. They can use natural language queries in the conversational interface to initiate actions like code generation, repository management, and version control.

### Frontend-Backend Communication

When a user interacts with the conversational interface or triggers an action in the UI, messages or API requests are sent to the backend server.

### Backend-GitHub API Interaction

The backend server processes the incoming requests and interacts with the GitHub API to perform the specified actions.

### Response and Feedback

The backend server sends the results and responses back to the frontend, where they are displayed in the conversational interface (IFrame) or the UI.

## Conclusion

GitBotAI is a comprehensive and powerful web app that empowers developers with an intuitive conversational AI chatbot and advanced GitHub integration. With its seamless frontend-backend communication and secure GitHub API interactions, GitBotAI is a valuable assistant for developers, enhancing productivity and simplifying various GitHub-related tasks. Whether working on individual projects or collaborating in a team, GitBotAI is designed to be a reliable and indispensable companion for developers worldwide.

## Registering and Releasing as a GitHub App

To register and release GitBotAI as a GitHub app, follow these steps:

1. **Register a new GitHub app**: Go to GitHub's [New OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) page, fill out the form, and click "Register application". For the "Authorization callback URL", enter the URL where your app is hosted.

2. **Set up a webhook for events**: In your app's settings page, go to the "Webhooks" section and click "Add webhook". Enter your app's URL in the "Payload URL" field, select "application/json" for the "Content type", and set the "Secret" to a secure random string.

   Here are the detailed steps to set up the webhook:

   1. Navigate to your app's settings page.
   2. Go to the "Webhooks" section.
   3. Click on "Add webhook".
   4. Enter your app's URL in the "Payload URL" field.
   5. Select "application/json" for the "Content type".
   6. Set the "Secret" to a secure random string.

3. **Configure permissions and repository access**: In your app's settings page, go to the "Permissions & webhooks" section. Set the necessary permissions for your app and specify which repositories your app can access.

4. **Install the app on a repository**: Use the `user_installation.py` script to install GitBotAI on a repository. You can find this script in the `workflow` directory of this repository. Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed and all necessary dependencies. The script takes two arguments: the name of the GitHub app and the name of the repository where you want to install the app.

5. **Release the app**: Go to your app's repository on GitHub, click "Releases", then "Draft a new release". Enter a tag version, release title, and description, then click "Publish release".
